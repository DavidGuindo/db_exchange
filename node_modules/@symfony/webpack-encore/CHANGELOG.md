# CHANGELOG

## 0.23.0

 * Add support for CSS modules in Vue - #508 thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Store externals in an array - #495 thanks to @deAtog

 * Add `Encore.isRuntimeEnvironmentConfigured()` - #500 thanks
   to @stof.

 * Add the ability to configure watch options - #486 thanks
   to @Kocal

 * Enabled cache and parallelism for terser for faster builds -
   #497 thanks to @Kocal

## 0.22.0

 * [BC BREAK] The values/paths in entrypoints.json were previously
   stripped of their opening slash. That behavior has been changed:
   the opening slash is now included: Before: `build/foo.js`, After: `/build/foo.js`.

## 0.21.0

 * [BC BREAK] Webpack was upgraded to version 4. This includes a number of major
   and minor changes. The changes are listed below under the
   `Webpack 4 Upgrade` section.

 * [BC BREAK] The `createSharedEntry()` no longer can be passed an array of files.
   Instead, set this to just one file, and require the other files from inside that
   file.

 * [DEPRECATION] You must now call either `Encore.enableSingleRuntimeChunk()`
   or `Encore.disableSingleRuntimeChunk()`: not calling either method is
   deprecated. The recommended setting is `Encore.enableSingleRuntimeChunk()`.
   This will cause a new `runtime.js` file to be created, which must be included
   on your page with a script tag (before any other script tags for Encore
   JavaScript files). See the documentation above `enableSingleRuntimeChunk()` in
   `index.js` for more details.

 * [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] Previously, without any config, Babel was
   configured to "transpile" (i.e. re-write) your JavaScript so
   that it was compatible with all browsers that currently have
   more than 1% of the market share. The new default behavior
   is a bit more aggressive, and may rewrite even more code to
   be compatible with even older browsers. The *recommendation*
   is to add a new `browserslist` key to your `package.json` file
   that specifies exactly what browsers you need to support. For
   example, to get the old configuration, add the following to
   `package.json`:

```json
{
    "browserslist": "> 1%"
}
```

See the [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) library
for a full description of all of the valid browser descriptions.

 * Added a new `copyFiles()` method that is able to copy static files
   into your build directory and allows them to be versioned. #409
   thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Introduced a new `configureSplitChunks()` method that can be
   used to further configure the `optimizations.splitChunks` configuration.

 * A new `entrypoints.json` file is now always output. For expert
   use-cases, the `optimizations.splitChunks.chunks` configuration
   can be set via `configureSplitChunks()` to `all`. Then, you
   can write some custom server-side code to parse the `entrypoints.js`
   so that you know which `script` and `link` tags are needed for
   each entry.

 * The "dynamic import" syntax is now supported out of the box
   because the `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import` babel plugin
   is always enabled. This allows you to do "Dynamic Imports"
   as described here: https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports

 * A new "version check" system was added for optional dependencies.
   Now, when you install optional plugins to support a feature, if
   you are using an unsupported version, you will see a warning.
   "Package recommendation" errors (i.e. when you enable a feature
   but you are missing some packages) will also contain the version
   in the install string when necessary (e.g. `yarn add foo@^2.0`).

 * Support was added `handlebars-loader` by calling `enableHandlebarsLoader()`.
   #301 thanks to @ogiammetta

 * Support was added for `eslint-loader` by calling `enableEslintLoader()`.
   #243 thanks to @pinoniq

 * The `css-loader` can now be configured by calling `configureCssLoader()`.
   #335 thanks to @XWB

 * It's now possible to control the `exclude` for Babel so that you can
   process certain node_modules packages  through Babel - use
   the new second argument to `configureBabel()` - #401 thanks to
   @Lyrkan.

## Webpack 4 Upgrade Details

 * Node 7 is no longer supported. This is because the new
   `mini-css-extract-plugin` does not support it (and neither)
   does Yarn.

 * For Preact, the necessary plugin the user needs to install
   changed from `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx` to `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`.

 * The NamedModulesPlugin was removed.

 * The `babel-preset-env` package (which was at version ^1.2.2) was
   removed in favor of `@babel/preset-env`.

 * ExtractTextPlugin was removed and replaced with
   mini-css-extract-plugin. Accordingly, `extractTextPluginOptionsCallback()`
   was removed.

 * Support for CoffeeScript was entirely removed.

 * Actual lang="sass" no longer works for Vue. However, lang="scss"
   continues to work fine.

 * uglifyjs-webpack-plugin was replaced by terser-webpack-plugin.
   If you're using `configureUglifyJsPlugin()`, please switch to
   `configureTerserPlugin()` instead.

## 0.20.1

    always having a DefinePlugin enabled (#172), fixing extra

   // Before: if you had this
   window.jQuery = require('jquery');
